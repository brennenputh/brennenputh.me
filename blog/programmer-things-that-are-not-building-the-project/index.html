  Programmer Things That Aren&#x27;t Building The Project

<p>Written as an extension to <em><a href="https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-thing">things that aren't doing the thing</a></em> because there are a lot of things that I tend to think are building the project which are in reality not building the project<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Naming the project is not building the project.</p>
<p>Fixing your broken Arch install is not building the project.</p>
<p>Considering how your project fits with other projects is not building the project.</p>
<p>Writing a blog post about how the project could be done is not building the project.</p>
<p>Wondering how your project will be received is not building the project.</p>
<p>Choosing a language is not building the project.</p>
<p>Configuring your dev environment is not building the project.</p>
<p>Running an initialization command (<code>cargo new</code>, or <code>npm init</code>, or <code>go mod init</code>, or any other) is not (yet) building the project.</p>
<p>Letting a LLM run wild on your project is not building the project<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Scanning for micro-optimizations in the project is not building the project.</p>
<p>All of these things may at some point be part of the project. You will know when. Most days, they're little distractions while I avoid building the project for the first time.</p>

<p>I might do another one of these, when I've built more projects. I think of a lot of things as I build the project to avoid building the project.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Sorry, couldn't help myself. It might be building the project, but you're not going to convince me it's building the project you should be proud of.</p>
