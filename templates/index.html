  Welcome to my corner of the internet!
  I currently study Computer Science and Cyber Operations at Cedarville University.
</p>
<p>
  My blog is where I write up whatever I find interesting at the moment.
  My hobbies include technology (obviously), cardistry, and whatever other skill catches my eye.
  I am also interested in how to build intentional local communities, so I will likely post some wanderings about that as well.
  Follow along via <a href="{{ get_url(path="rss.xml", trailing_slash=false) }}">RSS</a> if any of that sounds interesting!
</p>
<p>
  You can find what I've worked on at my list of <a href="{{ get_url(path='@/projects/_index.md') }}">projects</a>.
  Alternatively, you can take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/brennenputh">GitHub</a> to see what I've been up to most recently.
</p>
<p>
  If you'd like to reach out for any reason, you can use <a href="mailto:bputh.blog@gmail.com">bputh.blog@gmail.com</a>.
  I can't promise I'll get to anything I recieve immediately, but I'll be checking the inbox regularly.
