<h1 class="title">Brennen Puth</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently a Computer Science student at Cedarville University. This is my
  place to experiment and play, and perhaps produce something of value
  occasionally.
</p>
<p>
  My blog is the primary place you'll see new content from me.
  Don't expect any specific theme for it, I post what I'm thinking about which varies immensely from technology to philosophy and more.
  If you would like to follow along via RSS, the link is <a href="{{ get_url(path="rss.xml", trailing_slash=false) }}">here</a>.  It should be picked up by most readers automatically.
</p>
<p>
  You can find what I've worked on at my list of <a href="{{ get_url(path='@/projects/_index.md') }}">projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you'd like to reach out for any reason, you can use <a href="mailto:bputh.blog@gmail.com">bputh.blog@gmail.com</a>.
  When I say anything, I do mean anything - technology I've written about, cool books to read, even just to make a connection.
  I can't promise I'll get to anything I recieve immediately, but I'll be checking the inbox regularly.
