<h1 class="title">Brennen Puth</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently a Computer Science student at Cedarville University. This is my
  place to experiment and play, and perhaps produce something of value
  occasionally.
</p>
<p>
  My <a href="{{ get_url(path='@/blog/_index.md') }}">blog</a> is the primary
  place you'll see new content from me (in the rare case I take free time to do something releasable).
</p>
<p>
  You can find what I've worked on at my list of <a href="{{ get_url(path='@/projects/_index.md') }}">projects</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to contact me, you can use <a href="mailto:bputh.blog@gmail.com">bputh.blog@gmail.com</a>.
  I can't promise I'll get to anything I recieve immediately, but I'll try to check the inbox at least once a week.
