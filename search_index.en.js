post was almost entirely inspired by Andreas Karlson's blog post where he details how he created the worst version of an isOdd function ever to visit this land.\nAndreas's 4 billion if statements cover the whole of 32-bit integers, and ultimately were written in Assembly to avoid compiler limits from C++.\nOf course, when I saw this post, I wondered, how crippled would a browser be to read a 4 billion if statement WASM program?\nI started my exploration in a similar way: I attempted to write a Rust program that compiled to WASM for the simplest solution.\nUsing a Python script to generate the if statements, I used the first wasm-pack base I found and gave Rust a shot.\nThis went well for smaller numbers (under 2^20 or so).  After reaching 2^20, the Rust compile times became absurdly long.\nThe file with 2^8 if statements compiled in about 10 seconds.  The file with 2^16 took about 8 minutes.\nWhen I tried the file with 2^24 if statements, the Rust compiler still tried, but ultimately I had to go to bed and shut it down after about three hours.\nThis isn't too surprising, since the Rust compiler is optimized for safety, but I did want a WASM file with 4 billion if statements before the end of the millenia still.\nWhen Rust took too long, I decided the C/C++ to WASM route was probably also improbable for the same reason as in the original rendition.  The compiler won't like a 330GB code file.\nI may also have decided this because I really wanted to mess with writing binaries, but that's not the point here.\nThe point here is that the plan was to write the WASM by hand.\nSince I didn't have any prior experience with working with binary formats, I started by compiling a simple WASM program which did a single comparison, and parsed that in order to understand what was going on.\nWith a single if statement, I was able to begin understanding the binary format.  Here's the quick explanation:\nWASM files all start with the following bytes, the first four are a special sequence (equivalent to \\0asm) and the latter four are a version number.  WASM is on version one at the time of writing.\n\nThe next step is the types section.  Quick detour about sections, every one starts with a id and then a LEB128 encoded number which defines the length of the section.\nThe type section has an id of 3 and will contain a single function type, taking a i32 parameter and returning a i32.  Booleans in WASM are represented by i32, returning a 0 or 1.\n\nI won't go too far into the details of the type here, you can take a look at the WASM instruction list yourself if you get curious.\nThe function also has to be defined separately in the function section, which is simple enough.\n\nTo translate, we are declaring we are in section id 3, giving it a length of 2, and reporting which types the function has in the func section of the module.\nI don't fully understand this bit either, don't worry.  All that's important here is that the compiler expects it.\nFinally, the function needs a name, given in the export section.  This is also the section that makes the function available from JavaScript.\n\nThe gist of this one is that the ASCII for the function name isOdd is encoded into the bytes of the section.\nAll of this can come together into a simple Python script to write the preamble for our code.\n\nThe final 0A byte is to start the code section.\nWith all that tedious work out of the way, now comes the fun part.  Unlike in raw Assembly, the resulting WASM file is exporting a function.  WASM doesn't have anything to the effect of return true that we can use.\nThe easy version of the code in a sane language would've looked like this.\n\nInstead, WASM forces us into a paradigm that looks more like this.\n\nThis isn't a huge issue, but it forces a slightly different code structure where we have to end all of those else statements at some point.\nThe other issue is that we can't have all 4 billion if statements in memory at once, or my Linux environment likes to freeze up and kill the process.  Instead, we write byte by byte appending into the file.\nThis doesn't seem like an issue until you remember that we don't really know how long the code is until we generate it, and I don't want to go back and write into a specific byte of the file because I'm lazy and don't feel like it.\nWe'll solve that issue later, though, and just focus on getting the code written for now.  I'll pretend I have it solved by making a variable and dealing with it later.\n\nFor the actual code part, the concept is simple.  WASM is a stack-based language, which means you do operations by pushing values onto the stack.\nTo do the simple comparison (if (x == 1)), it takes four steps.  First, grab the local variable (x) with the bytes 20 00, 20 meaning get a local variable, and 00 being the first one.\nSecond, push the constant value to compare with onto the stack with 41 ??, 41 being load constant and ?? being our number to load.  The number is encoded in LEB128 format, which will make life a little harder later, but not much.\nThird, compare the two and leave that value on the stack with 46, which is the instruction for == in WASM.\nFourth, the if statement is represented with 04 7F, with 04 being the if and 7F being the return type of i32.\nFifth, to write our code inside this if statement, 41 ?? returns whether the value resulted in true or false.\nFinally, the end of the if statement is capped off with a else, with 05.\nThe only thing left to do then is create one more branch for anything that doesn't fit these values, and cap off all those if statements with end statements.\nThe full code for all of this is below.\n\nNow it is time to return to the issue earlier of figuring out the code size before we've written the code.  Turns out, this is a simple enough problem to solve iteratively, and since I'm lazy, I did that.\nThere might be a smarter mathematical way of doing this.\n\nThe reason for the math.floor bit is because of the LEB128 encoding.  Every time the number grows by 7 powers of 2, it gains an extra byte of code size per if statement.\nAfter all this, I finally have a Python script capable of writing the program I want.\nYou'll notice I have a limit variable used in the earlier two snippets for convenience, so I can quickly change the number of if statements.\nLet's start with a size of 2^8 if statements, just to make sure it's working.\n\nWhen I run it using a quick index.js I whipped up with isOdd(1), I get a value of true.  Exactly what I wanted, and the WASM parses correctly!\nA quick test with 2^16 gives the same result, so I decide to go ahead and try a value of 2^32.\nAfter an hour, it's still running.  Must be stuck writing the file, right?  Nope, it's stuck in the function_size bit.\nI tried in vain to optimize it to the point where it won't take many hours to calculate the function size, but while testing, I stumbled across something unfortunate.\nA limit of 2^24 causes the WASM compiler within Firefox to give up.  Turns out, WASM has a hard limit on the size of a function body.\nThere was no need to finish optimizing so that I could have my 2^32 WASM file, my dreams have been dashed.\nI did some playing to reach the exact number, and the max limit I could reach via this strategy was 590063.\nWithin the time I set aside for this project, I couldn't quite solve this.  The only idea I have to get around this hard limit is to start dividing into multiple functions.\nFor that, though, you have to dynamically generate the functions as well, so I decided to let this one rest for now.  Perhaps I shall return someday, and a browser will load a WASM file containing all 4 billion if statements.\n","id":"https://brennenputh.me/blog/590-thousand-if-statements/","title":"590 Thousand If Statements, For the Web"},"https://brennenputh.me/blog/bpos-why-and-what/":{"body":"I previously ran primarily Arch on all my systems.\nI don't think that it was particularly thoughtful on my part, I followed the \"cool kids\" of Linux.\nExperiences of breakage were rare for me, but I realized I was doing too much playing sysadmin on my own computer.\nIn the rare occasion something broke I was never sure whether the failure was on the hardware's part or the software's, which cost me a day of debugging.\nGranted, I enjoyed that debugging some, but I don't have the time to assess failures on my computer and reliably do productive work on it.\nThe secondary problem I found was the setup time.\nIf Arch requires a reinstall, better hope you wrote a script, because getting everything the way you like it again is otherwise costs hours.\nAfter a particularly bad breakage, someone pointed me to the Universal Blue project.\nIf you're unfamiliar, they provide bootable containers.\nBootable containers give you the experience of a Docker container on the desktop.\nIf something breaks on the image, you can always go back to the last version without an issue, all your data stays safe.\nUniversal Blue provides images for KDE and GNOME, which was fine for testing but I much prefer my tiling window manager for daily use.\nLuckily, their frontpage mentions the awesome power of the technology they build upon.\nAnyone can create their own custom operating system image, and it takes less than 30 minutes to set up (assuming a base level of familiarity with the CLI and Git).\nSo, I built my own image.\nThe source is here, although honestly it's not that interesting.\nWhich is exactly how I wanted it, because the more boring my image setup is, the less work I'll have to do.\nI haven't had a single day where my computer breaks entirely yet, because if it ever breaks, I just roll back to the last deployment (or, if it doesn't boot, it does that itself).\nQuick sidenote to mention, desktop files are awesome, and now that I have a proper place I can store them, I will be making far more.\nI now have all sorts of shortcuts that I can launch right from my desktop with my application launcher.\nIf you look in the repository, you'll see I have a few set up for different web services I use.\nI really don't have that much more to say about all of this, I just hope some more people take a look at the awesome work all the members of Universal Blue are doing, and this is my encouragement to continue on for all of them.\nIf you want to check out their images for yourself, their website is a good place to start.\nIf you want to build your own image like I have, check out the image-template repository they set up.\nP.S.

We also read his book named Jayber Crow which exemplifies the same values in the life of a character. His observations of a centrifugal force which pulls people into a city and kills any small country town nearby sounds eerily similar to the effect of large social media platforms on the Internet. These large platforms draw you in and entice you to stay. This kills smaller digital spaces, because it is easier to visit one place and see everything you want rather than visit five to ten places all of which may or may not be immediately pleasurable.\nI am unfortunately too young to have seen the Internet in its early days. From what I have heard, reading various blogs of lament, the Internet started out similar to the American countryside of Berry's description1. A connected group of small towns, each of them offering a few of the services you need. Anything not in your town can likely be found by taking one of the roads to the next town over. A hyperlink is the digital space equivalent to a road2. I would call the collection of digital spaces and hyperlinks the geographic digital map.\nEach road you create from your space to another location provides your viewer an option, to stay where they went or to return to the source of the link. If you send them to a place designed to capture their attention, all you can expect is that one day they won't choose to come back.\nI think our culture is finally realizing the effects of creating hyperlinks to cities, in one way or another. I have read several blog posts which are a call to revive the old Internet, where websites were run by small groups or individuals. Each space had its own culture and its own style, a way of acting which was unique to itself and the people who made up the space. This has seen some level of traction, especially with programmers like myself who desire the freedom to just write HTML. Substack as a platform espouses this value by giving each creator their own blog area on the website, although it still has an algorithmic feed so it loses points for that. In any case, the question I'm asking is: How do we stop people from moving to the cities, and revive the older Internet?\nOne of Berry's central ideas in the essay is that to have local community, you must have local economy. On the Internet, the economy consists of both regular old currency and more importantly the currency of attention. In some sense, even though I put no ads on my blog and thereby have no monetary gain from it, I am participating in the economy by holding the attention of you, the reader. You're welcome. Hopefully I shouldn't have to prove the attention economy too much, our culture has been buzzing with the idea3.\nIn order to recapture the local communities of people on the internet, we must do our best to keep the economy local.\nThe issue with local economy on the Internet becomes finding the local communities as a traveler. This is quite analogous to visiting a new country for the first time.\nSay I want find a small town in England. I don't have much knowledge of England, so I'll go find a map.\nThis is what Google gives for a quick search of \"England map\".\n\nObserving this map, I can clearly see the large cities, but it won't help me find a smaller town. Using Google for searching the Internet map creates a similar feeling. A generic search query usually only turns up the cities of the Internet. Refining my search query to around a specific area, say, around Leeds, I'll quickly find some of the smaller towns. Unfortunately, search engines don't quite mimic the real-life map. Speaking from personal experience, a refined query leads to a whole bunch of SEO-optimized websites and AI overviews trying to grab my attention still.\nI have a few thoughts about how the Internet map can be made more useful, especially around these smaller communities.\nAs a maintainer of a digital space, I want to focus on keeping viewers on a smaller network of sites which aren't designed to optimize the attention economy, including but not limited to my own. One of the best strategies I've seen for this is a webring. A webring links a whole bunch of similarly minded sites together forming a community. Unfortunately, I'm not yet cool enough to be in one4. If each website represents a person, or maybe even a business, a webring would represent a town. A town would be just a bunch of shops who have agreed to be near each other for convenience, without any governing power other than the community around them (and perhaps a sheriff, if the community deems it necessary). This seems to me the easiest way forward to create roads between smaller websites and blogs, and gather them into the equivalent of a local map. Keeping the economy of attention inside the webring builds the community.\nAs a viewer, my hope to run from the city and invest in small communities. My personal strategy for this is to use a RSS reader to keep tabs on my favorite blogs, where I have to intentionally go out of my way to subscribe to someone if I want to hear from them. Furthermore, I send a message through their platform if I have questions. I also might subscribe to a webring, if I want to hear from all sorts of creators in a topic area. Other strategies I've tried are blocking algorithmic feeds and sometimes even removing the ability to access the city-size websites entirely.\nAll of that written, I'm still learning and working on it myself! I want to continue considering better strategies to steward my digital spaces, especially including this blog. If this article made you think of anything else that could be done to structure online spaces to foster the feeling of local community, my inbox is open. Also, definitely check out the essay linked at the beginning of the article if you're interested in further understanding the idea. Berry writes with a clearer voice than I know how to.\n\n\n\n\nCould be wrong. Again, I wasn't lucky enough to have seen it.

Of the syntax?\nPerhaps I'll write up my full opinions on this later, but suffice it to say for now that syntax should not be the goal of teaching programming.\nOf course, you need a framework, so you teach someone how to express something in syntax.\nI'm not insane enough (yet) to propose a pure pseudocode curriculum, and besides, that would only swap one sort of syntax for another.\nWhat I want is for the syntax and design of the language not to get in the way of learning.\nUnfortunately, there is no way around syntax at a fundamental level.\nAt some point the language must be in the learning programmer's way, and I don't think that's a bad thing.\nSo if we can't improve the language, the tooling is the next best thing.\nI believe there exist a few tools which both do not inhibit learning and are ubiquitous among languages (unless you write your own, I suppose).\nIn-Editor Code Analysis\nI can hear the comments now. \"You've practically just allowed an IDE!\"\nLook. There comes a time to make people watch their syntax carefully as they write it.\nIt's not while you're learning how a computer thinks.\nThe faster the feedback loop, the better the learning.\nThe amount of people I've helped who waited to compile until they were done typing a whole bunch of incorrect code, simply because compiling takes a lot of keystrokes, is insane.\nWhile teaching \"compile and test often\" is good, it should not take 20 keystrokes to check your syntax is right.\nCode Formatter\nCedarville (where I'm getting my bachelors), at the very least, has a C++ and Java programming format policy.\nI highly appreciate the effort.\nOnly, code formatters solved that problem a while ago.\nThere's an opinionated formatter for basically every commonly taught language, and it should be standard to leave most of the formatting to it.\nSome examples in modern (and not modern) programming languages:\n\nclang-format for C++.\nrustfmt for Rust.  It's inbuilt into the Rust install, anyways.\nblack for Python.\nGo just has a inbuilt command. No need to even install anything.\n\nI omitted Java, because there is no good argument for not using a Java IDE, which should come with all of the tools I mention here and more.\nThe point is, formatting is something to give to tools.\nStandardize a config for your clang-format, not a formal specification document (specifically in the context of teaching).\nEspecially when languages have begun to bundle these sorts of tools, it's absolutely silly to insist that your format is better.\nFrom a teaching and grading perspective, the formatters also can help.\nMost of these tools also have a validate mode to ensure the input code is already formatted.\nCode Formatter, pt 2\nA tool which closes a bracket for you, or maybe spaces out your brackets as you hit Enter instead of afterwards.\nThis is something I went without for a while on my Neovim config, and it was incredibly painful.\n\nCredit XKCD for the image.\nAn Ending\nI consider this document to be a \"standard of living\" for a new programmer.\nVim and Vim alone is a terrible strategy when we have tools to help.\nSo long as those tools teach good behavior and get out of the programmer's way as much as possible, I see no reason not to use them.\nI will admit, it's also a personal preference.\nHelping people who don't format their code nicely until they submit pains every programming instinct I have.\n","id":"https://brennenputh.me/blog/teaching-text-editing/","title":"Thoughts on Teaching Text Editing"},"https://brennenputh.me/blog/the-social-binary/":{"body":"A few years ago, my friends and I decided to have a weekly movie night. Now, since we're all at college and living in dorms less than a 10 minute walk from each other, that was pretty easy.\nAt the beginning, we simply told each other during the day the plans for that night. That way, we don't have to think that hard about it until the day of.\nOf course, eventually others heard about this weekly rhythm, and were slowly invited to join us for it. The issue is, word of mouth doesn't scale very well in our culture.\nTherefore, someone creates The Group Chat. The Group Chat contains everything you need to know about our circle of friends, especially the information about this weekly rhythm. We all love The Group Chat, because what used to be a fraught process where people might be accidentally left out now by default includes everyone.\nAnd then people continue to be added to The Group Chat. This happens in several ways, although the all-time hits usually include \"You're coming tonight? Let me add you to The Group Chat!\" and \"I'll just invite _____ to The Group Chat, it'll be easier that way.\"\nPlatforms particularly seceptible to this have the (honestly nice) feature of adding someone to an existing chat, although platforms without that feature are not excluded.\nOne day, I woke up and realized my small social gathering of friends has now grown to a almost corporate production, where a movie is played every week.\nThe movie-watching group has grown immensely, and the post-movie time usually feels more akin to leaving class than to friendly community.\nI never know who might come to any given event, nor do I particularly care. The activity is the center of the event, not the people I am with.\nThroughout this experience, I understood deeper how community works, and specifically how technology has broken it.\nThere are so many thoughts which race through my head on this topic, but I'll restrict myself to one road for today.\nProblem\nComputers work using 1s and 0s. On or off. A binary system.\nHumans are \"squishy\". They have friends for one task, but don't necessarily always want them around. Opinions drift over time.\nWhy do we treat humans as if they will perfectly map onto computers?\n\n\"The map is not the territory\" - Alfred Korzybski\n\nPulling on the thread of common sense, a finite number of 1s and 0s cannot accurately represent the ability of a human to think. (I believe that would be impossible entirely, but hopefully all can agree we're not there yet.)\nAs a programmer, I hope to be making good representations of reality knowing this is true.\nSince I cannot perfectly represent the territory (human conversation) on the map (computer), I should be considering which capabilities I need in order to represent the important parts, hopefully cheaply.\nThe rest of this post shifts to look at which features I think have mapped technology well, and which ones are conveniences that don't actually fit the reality of the territory.\nObservations\nQuick Replies\nI can give a quick yes or no to my friend. This is my #1 use for instant messaging, where I just need to communicate a quick detail or fact.\nMaps to real life decently well, because it's similarly quick to send a yes or no message to a friend in person.  This usage mostly just shortens the feedback loop.\nAnnouncements\nWhile not everyone can write a good announcement, those who can do a masterful job of keeping their community informed.\nIn the case of my movie-watching group earlier, when the group got big, messaging systems worked significantly better which is not particularly a downside.\nEven beyond the benefits of instantly sending the announcement to everyone, anyone can go back and re-read the message to make sure of what you said. Much better than word of mouth where memory is concerned, especially in this age where we've lost that power.\nAsynchrony\nSince time immemorial, humans have been writing down things so that other humans can read them later.\nEven better, so that other humans can respond to them later.\nInstant messaging gets this perfect. No one has to worry that they asked the question hours ago, someone can still get back to them when they have time.\nThe efficiency of posting allows more than one question to be asked, just like in real life.  Some people are not quite fluent with the keyboard, but that seems similar to real life as well.\nOverbearing Access\nAt all times, I can text my friend and know he will recieve. The speed and reliability of the medium mean I can make no excuses for my friend ignoring my text, except that he may be bad at checking his phone.\nThis doesn't map real life at all, except by a simulation of being nearby another person. A short-range conversation, this exactly replicates what's happening. A long-distance communication, there will always be some risk involved that my message won't reach the recipient.\nThis is in the neutral category because the answer is that it depends on what sort of interaction you want to mirror.\nIncomplete Interaction\nLots of information is lost in transport when it comes to messages. The same holds for any written communication, meaning this one maps fairly well and I don't have much to say about it.\nWe've found ways to deal with this in our written-first world. Emoji come to mind, along with the wonderful tone indicators such as /s and /lh.\nLack of Drift\nFor good reason, friendships form and dissolve all the time. If the solution to tracking this change is to kick people out (unusual in real life under non-toxic circumstances) or create a new group (usually high friction), you'll have a hard time mapping this to real life.\nThis is the one category for which I have an experiment I want to try. Perhaps, one could create a social service where no group chats will stick around, making The Group Chat impossible to create. Of course, one would need a full text search of good quality, which sounds like a fun challenge to me.\nIgnore my digression into solutions though, and consider that reducing the friction to tracking these drifting changes in my opinion is the best way to solve this natural drift.\nConclusion\nMy words are neither exhaustive nor inerrant - I deeply hope that this will spark some discussion and perhaps begin to push the needle toward a human-centric design for instant messaging.\nI also hope that, even if you disagree with me on every point or think I wrote this poorly (to which I say, you're probably right), you'll use this as an opportunity for reflection on how you use these chat systems and how they influence the relationships you care about most.\n","id":"https://brennenputh.me/blog/the-social-binary/","title":"The Fake Social Binary"},"https://brennenputh.me/projects/":{"body":"Professional &amp; Volunteer\nPrayer Wheels for Covered Ministries\nAn app to facilitate focused and intentional prayer, providing a timer and instructions.\nWritten in React and TypeScript.\nOriginally built during the 2024 LightSys Code-A-Thon and finished throughout the rest of the year.\nWPILib AprilTagFieldLayout\nThe original implementation of WPILib's AprilTagFieldLayout classes, merged in late 2022.\nIncludes a definition of the field AprilTag JSON layout in C++ and Java.\nPersonal\nbpOS\nA bootc container image based on Universal Blue's offerings customized for my own personal needs.
