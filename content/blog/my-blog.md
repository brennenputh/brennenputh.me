If you are reading this, you have reached far back in time (or you're very early to reading my blog, hi bots!).
I thought I might as well have a blog around somewhere, and it seemed simple enough to set up.
Despite my general dislike of webdev, I managed to put together a Hugo site.

My hopes for this blog are fairly simple, to have a place to contain my thoughts.
Usually it will be on things related to computing, but perhaps I'll also foray into other things I want to study.
For the most part, however, it will be silent.  Until I have something to say, that's alright, I suppose.
