I take a lot of pleasure in enjoying beautiful things.
Recently, I've been reading Augustine's Confessions with a few friends.
My friends are altogether more capable than me of diving into and analyzing the text.
My thoughts usually have all the intellectual significance of a child telling you about the cool rock they just found.
Admittedly, the rock sometimes actually *is* cool, so I don't beat myself up too much about it.

None of my experience would tell me that my discovery is anything but empty.
Still, I must share it with whoever will listen, because I found it beautiful.
I want those who I tell to look at the rock with me and feel the awe I feel about it.
It works for my own good and others' good to consider a good thing.
Perhaps they have a more concrete thought about the truth within the rock, or a discussion about the rock can be had to help us both.

For a long time, I thought my contributions of "Come, Look" were useless.
If I could not contribute a fully formed idea, what worth could that idea have?
What I missed is the wonderful way community works.
If both myself and my friend are built up through looking at something beautiful, even if we both admit a lack of understanding about it, why shouldn't I extend the invitation to come and look?
